# ðŸ‘‹ Kia Ora! I'm Sam.

I'm completing a **BSc (Hons**) in **AI** at **Victoria University of Wellington**, where I study machine learning and data science. My [research project](https://github.com/sam-mata/antarctic-genetic-modelling) investigates the use of genetic models for modelling changes in the Antarctic Ice Shelf.

I also work as a **Full-Stack Web Developer** at **Ordino Ltd.**, where I make websites and mobile applications with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript.
